# Workflow steps

To streamline the **data analysis process**, {{project__name}} follows a
structured workflow divided into **five key steps**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    a(Project)
    b(Model)
    c(Experiment)
    d(Analysis)
    e(Summary)
    a --> b
    b --> c
    c --> d
    d --> e
```

- [:material-archive: Project](project.md) - Establish a **project** as a
  container for data, settings, and analysis results.
- [:material-puzzle: Model](model.md) -
- [:material-microscope: Experiment](experiment.md) -
- [:material-calculator: Analysis](analysis.md) -
- [:material-clipboard-text: Summary](summary.md) - Generate a
  **detailed report** summarizing the results of the analysis, including
  refined parameters and visualizations.

Each step is described in detail in its respective section, guiding users
through the **entire {{project__short_description | lower}} workflow** in
{{project__name}}.
