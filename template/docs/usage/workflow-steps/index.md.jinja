# Workflow steps

To streamline the **data analysis process**, {{project__name}} follows a
structured workflow divided into **five key steps**:

- [:material-archive: Project](project) - Establish a **project** as a
  container for data, settings, and analysis results.
- [:material-puzzle: Model](model) - Load an existing
  **crystallographic model** in CIF format or define a new one from scratch.
- [:material-microscope: Experiment](experiment) - Import
  **experimental diffraction data** and configure instrumental parameters.
- [:material-calculator: Analysis](analysis) - Calculate the
  **diffraction pattern** and optimize the structural model by refining
  parameters to match experimental measurements.
- [:material-clipboard-text: Summary](summary) - Generate a
  **detailed report** summarizing the results of the analysis, including
  refined parameters and visualizations.

Each step is described in detail in its respective section, guiding users
through the **entire diffraction data analysis workflow** in
{{project__name}}.
