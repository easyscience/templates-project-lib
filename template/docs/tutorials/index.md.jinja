# :material-school: Tutorials

This section provides a collection of **Jupyter Notebook examples** that
demonstrate how to use {{project__name}} for various tasks. These tutorials
serve as **step-by-step guides**, helping users understand the workflow of
diffraction data analysis.

## Running Tutorials

In this documentation, the examples are presented as **static HTML pages** for
easy reference. However, you can also run them interactively in two ways:

- **Run Locally** – Download the Jupyter Notebook file and execute it on your
  computer.
- **Run Online** – Open and execute the tutorial directly in **Google Colab**,
  without requiring any local setup.

## Interactive Features

At the **top right corner** of each tutorial page, you will find:

- A :material-download: **download button** to save the example as a
  Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file.
- A :google-colab: **Google Colab button** to open and run the tutorial
  in Google Colab, allowing you to experiment with EasyDiffraction directly
  in your browser.

By using these interactive options, you can test, modify, and explore
EasyDiffraction's capabilities in a hands-on manner.
