# :material-school: Tutorials

This section provides a collection of **Jupyter Notebook examples** that
demonstrate how to use {{project__name}} for various tasks. These tutorials
serve as **step-by-step guides**, helping users understand the workflow of
diffraction data analysis in {{project__name}}.

## Running Tutorials

In this documentation, the examples are presented as **static HTML pages** for
easy reference. However, you can also run them interactively in two ways:

- **Run Locally** – Download the Jupyter Notebook file and execute it on your
  computer.
- **Run Online** – Open and execute the tutorial directly in **Google Colab**,
  without requiring any local setup.

## Interactive Features

At the **top right corner** of each tutorial page, you will find:

- A **download button** :material-download: to save the example as a
  Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file.
- A **Google Colab button** :google-colab: to open and run the tutorial
  in Google Colab, allowing you to experiment with {{project__name}}
  directly in your browser.

By using these interactive options, you can test, modify, and explore
{{project__name}}'s capabilities in a hands-on manner.
